# ninjaone-testcafe

This is my first time using TestCafe; pretty interesting stuff.

Please see [tests.ts](tests.ts) for additional commentary.

API client code is in [api.ts](api.ts); utility code is in [util.ts](util.ts).

Thanks for your consideration!

To run tests, start the frontend and backend, then:
```commandline
npm install
npx testcafe chrome tests.ts
```
